PKH Neural Network Project 

## Introduction 

The movement of treated macrophages to a tumor region impacts the efficacy of their immune response. Here, we aim to create models that predict the ability of a macrophage to infiltrate a tumor region given different environmental conditions, including physical space and chemoattraction.
